You’ll find this post in your `content/posts` directory.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `content/posts` directory that follows the convention `name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Hugo also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{{< highlight go >}}
package main
import "fmt"
func print_hi(name string) {
  fmt.Println("Hi, ", name)
}

func main() {
  print_hi("Tom")
}
//=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{{< /highlight >}}
